# rest-repo
Restaurant website for my portfolio

This restaurant website is built with pure css and sass.I didn't use any sorts of framework or library because I really wanted to showcase what I am capable of doing with css.I used
flexbox and grid as well as a little bit of animations.This website is also completely responsive.
